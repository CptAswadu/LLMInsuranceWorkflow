# Evaluating LLM Agents for Genetic Testing Insurance Workflows 

## This repository is a standalone export of ```RESCUE-n8n/eval/insurance``` (insurance_agent branch from https://github.com/stormliucong/RESCUE-n8n/tree/main/eval/insurance) for reproducibility.

📁 This folder contains the source codes, experimental outputs, and evaluation files associated with our study: **Evaluating Large Language Model Agents for Genetic Testing Insurance Workflows: An End-to-End Assessment of Retrieval and Reliability**.

## Requirements & Reproducibility Notes
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API key
- Perplexity API key
- SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small

## 🧠 Purpose

This study systematically evaluates the reliability of web-search-enabled LLM agents in supporting insurance workflows for **genetic testing**.
We assess performance across four sequential tasks:

1. **In-Network Insurance Provider Retrieval** 
2. **Policy Document Retrieval**
3. **Patient-Policy Match**
4. **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions**

The goal is to quantify retrieval sensitivity, ranking robustness, and downstream decision accuracy.

## 🧪 Experimental Tasks

1. **In-Network Provider Retrieval**  
- Objective: Evaluate whether LLM agents can correctly identify GeneDx in-network payers.  
- Input: Prompt-based queries (model × prompt × iteration).  
- Ground Truth: `dataset/In-Network_Providers_Update.csv`  
- Output: `results/name_retrieval/`  
- Evaluation: GPT-4o-based matching and computation ('codes/name_retrieval/execute_analysis.py').


2. **Policy Document Retrieval**  
- Objective: Assess whether LLM agents retrieve the correct genetic testing coverage policies.  
- Input: Insurance provider name + prompt configuration.  
- Output: Retrieved policy documents (PDF/HTML) + MD5 verification results.  
- Output Location: `results/policy_retrieval/`  
- Evaluation: MD5-based ground-truth comparison ('codes/policy_retrieval/assess.py').

3. **Patient-Policy match**  
- Objective: Retrieve the most relevant policy document for a given synthetic patient case.  
- Input: Synthetic patient case + policy embedding corpus (789 policies).  
- Output: Ranked policy candidates (Top-K) + reranking artifacts.  
- Output Location: `results/patient_policy_match/`  
- Evaluation: Match rate and reranking analysis ('codes/analysis_figures/match_rate_analysis.ipynb').


4. **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions**  
- Objective: Evaluate downstream insurance QA accuracy under document conditioning.  
- Input: Patient case ± policy document.  
- Settings:
  - Baseline (no document)
  - All-Correct (ground-truth document)
  - All-Incorrect (high-similarity incorrect document)
- Output Location: `results/LLM_QnA/`
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Adjusted_Accuracy, case-level statistical analysis between settings, question-wise statistical analysis ('codes/analysis_figures/Analysis.ipynb').

⚠️ The **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions** task depends on the outputs of the  **Patient–Policy Matching** task when running document-conditioned settings  (matched, unmatched, all_correct, all_incorrect).

Therefore, the Patient–Policy Matching task must be executed first 
to generate the required policy-document assignments.

The 'Baseline' setting (patient narrative only, without policy documents) can be executed independently.

## 📄 Insurance Policy Documents

A total of 789 publicly available genetic testing policy documents were used for embedding and retrieval experiments.

These documents are not redistributed in this repository due to size and licensing considerations.

Please send email to Dr.Cong Liu if you want to get access to collected policy documents (Cong.Liu@childrens.harvard.edu)

All policy documents are publicly accessible via the official payer websites:
- Aetna
- Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (BCBS FEP)
- Cigna
- United Healthcare

The experiments were conducted using the policy snapshot available at the time of study.

To reproduce embedding-based experiments:
1. Download the relevant genetic testing policies from payer websites.
2. Place them under a local directory.

Ground-truth md5 mappings between synthetic cases and policy documents
are provided in `dataset/final_ground_truth.json`.

## 📊 Evaluation Datasets

All evaluation datasets are located in the `dataset/` folder
- 'In-Network_Providers_Update.csv' for **In-Network Provider Retrieval** task
- 'qna_free_text_sample.json' for patient narrative samples for **Patient-Policy match** and **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions** tasks
- 'final_ground_truth.json' contains evaluation ground truth answer for **Patient-Policy match** and **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions** tasks
