# Code Structure

This directory contains modular implementations of the experimental components used in the LLM-based insurance workflow study for genetic testing.

Each task is executed via a dedicated entry script.  
All other Python files within each module serve as internal utilities (data loading, parsing, scoring, aggregation, etc.).

For policy retrieval task assessment, patient-policy match and QA task with document settings please store policy document first and set the directory.

## 🔹 Entry Scripts (One per Task)

| Stage | Task | Entry Script | Description | Outputs |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Stage 1 | Payer name retrieval | `name_retrieval/experiment.py` | LLM-based payer identification experiments | `results/name_retrieval/` |
| Stage 2 | Policy document retrieval | `policy_retrieval/experiment.py` | Policy link retrieval + MD5 verification | `results/policy_retrieval/` |
| Stage 3 | Patient–policy matching (ST + header) | `patient_policy_match/header_execute.py` | SentenceTransformer embedding + summarized policy input | `results/patient_policy_match/full/ST/header` |
| Stage 3 | Patient–policy matching (ST + whole policy) | `patient_policy_match/whole_policy_execute.py` | SentenceTransformer embedding + full policy text | `results/patient_policy_match/full/ST/policy` |
| Stage 3 | Patient–policy matching (OpenAI embedding) | `patient_policy_match/policy_openai.py` | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small + header/whole-policy input | `results/patient_policy_match/full/openai` |
| Stage 4 | Insurance QA Evaluation (OpenAI backbone) | `rag_qna/openai_embedding.py` | Executes structured insurance QA (Q0–Q8) under document-conditioning settings (Baseline (no document), all_correct, all_incorrect) using Text-embedding-3-small embedding based patient-policy matching (match/unmatch) results. This configuration is used in the manuscript. | `results/LLM_QnA/RAG/final/final_qna_results/open_ai` |
| Stage 4 | Insurance QA Evaluation (ST backbone) | `rag_qna/ST_embedding_qna.py` |Executes structured insurance QA (Q0–Q8) under document-conditioning settings (Baseline (no document), all_correct, all_incorrect) using SentenceTransformer embedding based patient-policy matching (match/unmatch) results.  | `results/LLM_QnA/RAG/final/final_qna_results/ST` |

### QA Document Conditioning Strategy

The QA module does not perform retrieval itself.  
Instead, it consumes previously generated patient–policy matching results and evaluates downstream QA performance under controlled document-conditioning scenarios: 

- **Baseline**  
  Patient narrative only (no policy document).

- **Matched**  
  The policy document retrieved by the patient–policy matching pipeline
  when the retrieved document matches the ground-truth policy.  

- **Unmatched**  
  The policy document retrieved by the patient–policy matching pipeline
  when the retrieved document does not match the ground-truth policy.  

- **All Correct**  
  Oracle condition where the ground-truth policy document is always provided.  

- **All Incorrect**  
  Adversarial condition where a high-similarity but incorrect policy document is provided for every case (excluding the ground truth).  

---
## 🔹 Configuration (Policy Document Directory)

For tasks that require policy documents (Policy Retrieval Assessment, Patient–Policy Matching, and QA with document conditioning), policy documents must be stored locally and the directory path must be set correctly before running the scripts.

- The scripts expect a local directory containing the policy documents.
- Please update the policy document directory path in the corresponding scripts before execution.  
- Policy documents are not distributed in this repository.  
  Multiple document sets were used in the experiments (full corpus, retrieval subset, and a small test set for pipeline verification).  
  Please contact **Dr. Cong Liu (Cong.Liu@childrens.harvard.edu)** if access to the collected policy corpus is required.  
---  

## 🔹 SentenceTransformer Model Download

The patient–policy matching module uses SentenceTransformer models
(`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) from Hugging Face.  

⚠️ **Important**

- During the **first execution**, the model files must be downloaded
  from the Hugging Face Hub.  
- Therefore, the following offline settings **must NOT be enabled** during the first run.  

```python
os.environ["TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE"] = "1"
os.environ["HF_HUB_OFFLINE"] = "1"
```  
Once the model has been downloaded and cached locally, the experiments
can be executed in offline mode by enabling these variables if desired.

This ensures that subsequent runs rely only on locally cached models
without accessing external servers.  
---  
## 🔹 Test Mode (Execution Setting)

Several entry scripts are configured with a **test mode**.  
```python
TEST_MODE = True
```  
If the setting is test mode, the script runs only a single sample case to verify that the pipeline works correctly.  

To run the full experiment used in the manuscript, this setting must be changed to:  
```python
TEST_MODE = False
```  
---  

> ⚠️ **Note**
>
> - Tasks **3 (Patient–Policy Match)** and **4 (LLM QA)** were executed using **GPT-5-Mini** in the experiments reported in the manuscript.
> - Some paths and configurations are **hardcoded for the GPT-5-Mini setup**.
> - If you use a different LLM or modify the experiment configuration, please adjust the relevant paths and model settings accordingly.
